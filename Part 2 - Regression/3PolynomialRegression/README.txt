Polynomial regression is considered to be a special case of multiple linear regression.
A polynomial termâ€“a quadratic (squared) or cubic (cubed) term turns a linear regression model into a curve.
But because it is X that is squared or cubed, not the Beta coefficient, it still qualifies as a linear model.
