# Correlations Between Attributes
	# Correlation refers to the relationship between two variables and how they may or may not change together.
	# The most common method for calculating correlation is Pearsonâ€™s Correlation Coefficient, that assumes a normal distribution of the attributes involved. 
	# A correlation of -1 or 1 shows a full negative or positive correlation respectively.

	# Whereas a value of 0 shows no correlation at all.

# Skew of Univariate Distributions
	# Image : univariate_skew_distribution.jpg
	# Skew refers to a distribution that is assumed Gaussian (normal or bell curve) that is shifted or squashed in one direction or another.
	# Knowing that an attribute has a skew may allow you to perform data preparation to correct the skew and later improve the accuracy of your models.
dataset.skew()
# The skew result show a positive (right) or negative (left) skew. Values closer to zero show less skew.
