Feature selection is a process where you automatically select those features in your data that contribute most to the prediction variable or output in which you are interested.

Three benefits of performing feature selection before modeling your data are:
  a). Reduces Overfitting: Less redundant data means less opportunity to make decisions based on noise.
  b). Improves Accuracy: Less misleading data means modeling accuracy improves.
  c). Reduces Training Time: Less data means that algorithms train faster.
